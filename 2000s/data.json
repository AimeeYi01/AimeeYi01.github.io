        "background": "R.W. Bishop embarked on a lifelong journey in the amusement park industry that began in 1947 with a converted Woody Wagon for selling popcorn. Starting with a street vendor license, Bishop operated his popcorn business at various local events and even expanded to New York and Michigan. Eventually, he transitioned into building rides after years of concession sales, crafting his first fun house out of a walk-in van. In 2000, Bishop purchased land in North Toledo, where he constructed his home and established Enchanted Forest Playland, envisioning it as a venue for corporate picnics and school outings. However, changing family dynamics and the rise of electronic entertainment led to a decline in the park's popularity, ultimately resulting in its closure in 2005. Reflecting on his journey, Bishop expressed satisfaction in pursuing his passion for building and maintaining rides despite the challenges encountered along the way."

Hurricane Katrina caused severe damage in 2005, leading to permanent closure in 2009. Salvaged rides were relocated, and redevelopment plans failed, leaving the site abandoned. City officials tightened security to deter trespassers. In 2019, demolition discussions arose due to resident complaints. In 2023, Bayou Phoenix received approval for redevelopment plans. Meanwhile, the city earns revenue by leasing the site as a filming location."

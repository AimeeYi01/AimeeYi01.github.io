          And surely you have seen, in the darkness of the innermost rooms of these huge buildings, to which sunlight
          never penetrates, how the gold leaf of a sliding door or screen will pick up a distant glimmer from the
          garden, then suddenly send forth an ethereal glow, a faint golden light cast into the enveloping darkness,
          like the glow upon the horizon at sunset. In no other setting is gold quite so exquisitely beautiful. You walk
          past, turning to look again, and yet again; and as you move away the golden surface of the paper glows ever
          more deeply, changing not in a flash, but growing slowly, steadily brighter, like color rising in the face of
          a giant. Or again you may find that the gold dust of the background, which until that moment had only a dull,
          sleepy luster, will, as you move past, suddenly gleam forth as if it had burst into flame.

          How, in such a dark place, gold draws so much light to itself is a mystery to me. But I see why in ancient
          times statues of the Buddha were gilt with gold and why gold leaf covered the walls of the homes of the
          nobility. Modem man, in his well-lit house, knows nothing of the beauty of gold; but those who lived in the
          dark houses of the past were not merely captivated by its beauty, they also knew its practical value; for
          gold, in these dim rooms, must have served the function of a reflector. Their use of gold leaf and gold dust
          was not mere extravagance. Its reflective properties were put to use as a source of illumination. Silver and
          other metals quickly lose their gloss, but gold retains its brilliance indefinitely to light the darkness of
          the room. This is why gold was held in such incredibly high esteem.

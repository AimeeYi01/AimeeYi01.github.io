          Of course the Japanese room does have its picture alcove, and in it a hanging scroll and a flower arrangement.
          But the scroll and the flowers serve not as ornament but rather to give depth to the shadows. We value a
          scroll above all for the way it blends with the walls of the alcove, and thus we consider the mounting quite
          as important as the calligraphy or painting. Even the greatest masterpiece will lose its worth as a scroll if
          it fails to blend with the alcove, while a work of no particular distinction may blend beautifully with the
          room and set off to unexpected advantage both itself and its surroundings. Wherein lies the power of an
          otherwise ordinary work to produce such an effect? Most often the paper, the ink, the fabric of the mounting
          will possess a certain look of antiquity, and this look of antiquity will strike just the right balance with
          the darkness of the alcove and room.

          For the painting here is nothing more than another delicate surface upon which the faint, frail light can
          play; it performs precisely the same function as the sand-textured wall. This is why we attach such importance
          to age and patina. A new painting, even one done in ink monochrome or subtle pastels, can quite destroy the
          shadows of an alcove, unless it is selected with the greatest care.

          We have all had the experience, on a visit to one of the great temples of Kyoto or Nara, of being shown a
          scroll, one of the temple&#39;s treasures, hanging in a large, deeply recessed alcove. So dark are these
          alcoves, even in bright daylight, that we can hardly discern the outlines of the work; all we can do is listen
          to the explanation of the guide, follow as best we can the all-but invisible brush strokes, and tell ourselves
          how magnificent a painting it must be. Yet the combination of that blurred old painting and the dark alcove is
          one of absolute harmony. The lack of clarity, far from disturbing us, seems rather to suit the painting
          perfectly.

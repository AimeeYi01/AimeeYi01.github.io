<div id="title"><h1>JELLY SANDALS</h1></div>

<div id="content">
	<p>This kind of brightly colored jelly sandals used to be popular among children, as children always yearn for Cinderella's glass slippers. In the real world, we can't get expensive glass slippers, so these shining, cheap sandals suffice for us. Most of these sandals are low-heeled, but some of them are high-heeled, with gemstones and bowknots, made like Disney princesses' shoes, so this kind of high heels is often more popular among children. These sandals are soft and light. In the summer, it was common to see girls wearing them, stepping on the ground, and making a clattering sound. But their quality is not that good, I've worn out a few pairs. In previous years, these kinds of jelly sandals were always said to be ugly, but the recent rise of the Y2K fashion style has made some fashionistas wear their childhood favorite sandals again and present them in a new way.</p>
